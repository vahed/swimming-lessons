            <p>All sessions are open to all pupils with the focus on individual progress, whatever the swimmers aspirations.
                There are boys and girls swimming classes in all age groups,whether your children are beginners or you're
                wanting to build their confidence, we cater for all levels of ability and will help them progress in the
                world of water</p>
            <p>During the lesson, the correct swimming technique will be explained, this will help them to understand
                the basic mechanics and movements required to swim. As they start to understand the technical aspects
                of the strokes, they will also be practicing drills and exercises to help them build muscle memory and
                learn how to swim. The  swimming lessons are 30 minutes in duration, which is broken down into drills.
                As they practice each drill, we will also stop them when we see something that needs to be corrected.
            </p>
            <p>We help people learn to love water and keep active by becoming capable and confident swimmers while 
                communicating in english at the same time, as our classes are held in english. That's why you should
                come to us to let us teach your children this vital life skill. Lessons are delivered on a rolling
                programme so your child can join at any stage and progress at their own pace.
